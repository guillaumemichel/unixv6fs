# Unix v6 FileSystem

Adrien Vandenbroucque and myself implemented an Unix v6 Filesystem from scratch in the context of the Systems programming class CS-212.

The filesystem was implemented in C language. We built the filesystem's data structures and implemented a simple shell that handles the necessary commands for the use of our filesystem.
